Throughout our history, we’ve fostered social justice and improved lives through academic excellence. And we continue to live and breathe this spirit today, not because it’s simply ‘the right thing to do’ but for what it helps us achieve and the intellectual brilliance it delivers. Our reformer heritage informs our conviction that great ideas can and should come from anywhere. It’s an approach that has brought results across the globe, from the communities of east London to the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. We continue to embrace diversity of thought and opinion in everything we do, in the belief that when views collide, disciplines interact, and perspectives intersect, truly original thought takes form.

The University is supported by the financial resources of the Vehbi Koc Foundation, set up by Vehbi Koc, a leading Turkish businessman, 'to serve humanity by increasing the number of people who can of service to the Turkish nation,' and is committed to the pursuit of excellence in both teaching and research. In October 2000 Koc University moved to its permanent campus at Rumeli Feneri, located on a hill close to the city but far removed from the distractions of city life. It sprawls over a sixty-two acre site. The sixty buildings, academic and administrative - laboratories, library, dormitories, faculty residences, social and sports facilities are the product of a meticulous, integrated design. Drawing upon warm and natural materials, including stone, plaster, wood and clay roof tiles, the architecture is a blend of the historical style of Istanbul and the timeless characteristics of well-established academic institutions."
