Today western Canada’s oldest university has two locations. The main campus in the south Winnipeg suburb of For Garry covers 274 hectares on the banks of the Red River. The second location is a complex of ten buildings called the Bannatyne Campus in central Winnipeg. Although the replacement cost of the university’s physical facilities is now estimated at $1 billion, the University of Manitoba led a nomadic existence during its first decade in borrowed or rented rooms. In these early years the university didn’t really need its own facilities because it was established when three church colleges – St. John’s College, St. Boniface college, and Manitoba College – petitioned the Manitoba legislature to set up an examination and degree granting agency."

Ohio State's roots go back to 1870, when the Ohio General Assembly established the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The new college was made possible through the provisions of the Land-Grant Act, signed by President Lincoln on July 2, 1862. This legislation revolutionized the nation's approach to higher education, bringing a college degree within reach of all high school graduates. The college's curriculum was a matter of bitter dispute among politicians, the public, and educators. One faction, the 'narrow gauge' group, held that the college should devote itself solely to the teaching of agriculture and mechanical arts. The 'broad gauge' faction wanted a wider program that featured English and ancient and foreign languages as well. Joseph Sullivant, a member of the first Board of Trustees, pushed the 'broad gauge' idea through the Board of Trustees, where it passed by a margin of 8-7. His legacy endures; Ohio State continues to offer a broad-based, liberal arts education and a diverse range of study."
